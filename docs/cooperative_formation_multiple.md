# Cooperative formation multiple

Although large-scale numerical simulations and small-scale experiments have shown promising results, 
a comprehensive theoretical understanding to smooth traffic flow via AVs is lacking. Here, from a 
control-theoretic perspective, we establish analytical results on the controllability, stabilizability, 
and reachability of a mixed traffic system consisting of HDVs and AVs in a ring road.

## Implementation

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
